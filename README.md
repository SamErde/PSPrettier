# PSPrettier

Prettier wrapped in a PowerShell module so PS devs can use it from the command line.

## Placeholder and Roadmap

This "module" is still an early stage concept without a proper structure and build process. Features to come will include:

- A helper function to install Prettier
- A helper function to install Node.js, if necessary
- Repack standalone binaries and ship them with the module to remove the dependency on Node.js
- And more...
